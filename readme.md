## Deploy

For deploying the project as a GitHub page, the command used is ``gulp deploy``, this command uses the functionality of [gulp-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages) and was declared in **gulpfile.js** file (thus, installing gulp-gh-pages and gulp is needed).

Also, please consider that deploying as a GitHub page is fine while the project is in development phase, for launch in production, is recomended to deploy somewhere else (your own server, preferably)
